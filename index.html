                    <p>"I wasan EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here, I  signed up for free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most gruelling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curricullum and staff did not disappiont, They were very hands on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The angle learn project, in particular, was outstanding, It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
